# Front-End Developer Assessment Repository

This repository contains my solutions to the technical prompts provided by Zephyrus Engineering Limited as part of the Front-End Developer assessment. Each solution showcases my skills in problem-solving, clean coding, and front-end development. Below is a detailed description of each file and its purpose.

## File Descriptions

### 1. `even_or_odd.js`
- **Purpose:** A JavaScript program that determines whether a given number is even or odd.
- **How It Works:**  
  The script takes an input number and uses a modulo operation (`%`) to check divisibility by 2. If the number is divisible by 2, it returns "Even"; otherwise, it returns "Odd".

---

### 2. `fizzbuzz.js`
- **Purpose:** A JavaScript implementation of the classic "FizzBuzz" problem.
- **How It Works:**  
  The script iterates through numbers from 1 to a specified limit. For each number:
  - If divisible by 3, it prints "Fizz".
  - If divisible by 5, it prints "Buzz".
  - If divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".
  - Otherwise, it prints the number itself.

---

### 3. `reverse_string.js`
- **Purpose:** A JavaScript function to reverse a given string.
- **How It Works:**  
  The function accepts a string input and processes it using array manipulation:
  - Converts the string into an array of characters.
  - Reverses the array using the built-in `.reverse()` method.
  - Joins the array back into a string and returns the result.

---

### 4. `index.html`
- **Purpose:** The HTML file designed for the front-end performance optimization question.
- **How It Works:**  
  - Provides the structure for a simple, responsive web page that emphasizes cross-browser compatibility and performance.
  - Integrates external and inline resources for optimal loading times.

---

### 5. `styles.css`
- **Purpose:** The CSS file for styling the web page described in `index.html`.
- **How It Works:**  
  - Enhances the visual appearance and usability of the web page.
